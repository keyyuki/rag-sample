Nx can manage its own installation without requiring a package.json file or a node_modules folder. This type of installation is useful for repositories that may not contain any JavaScript or TypeScript (e.g. .Net or Java based workspaces that want to leverage Nx features). In this setup, the Nx CLI is all contained within a .nx folder. To set this up run the nx init command in a folder without a package.json file..
